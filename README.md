**Battery Swapping Stations: A Sustainable Solution for Electric Vehicle Charging**

This project focuses on the development and implementation of battery swapping stations as a solution to address the challenges of electric vehicle (EV) charging. The traditional EV charging infrastructure often faces limitations such as long charging times and insufficient charging stations. Battery swapping offers an innovative alternative where pre-charged batteries can be exchanged in a matter of minutes, making the process quicker and more efficient. 

In this project, I explore the technical aspects of battery swapping systems, their potential integration into the current EV infrastructure, and the associated challenges such as standardization, costs, and user adoption. The project also includes a comparative analysis of battery swapping vs. conventional charging and its implications for the future of sustainable transportation.
